Welcome my Project for my Data Visualization dissertation 

# Introduction 
This project aims to extract and analyze the primary colors of frames from a movie or video. By performing color analysis on each frame, we can identify the dominant color, allowing us to gain insights into the visual composition of the video. I created this project to help me with my Data Visualization dissertation. 
# Features
Extract frames from a movie or video.
Perform color analysis to find the dominant color in each frame.
